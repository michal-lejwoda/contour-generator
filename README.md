# 🗻 Contour Generator Algorithm  

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- 🖥️ **C++** - core programming language  
- 📦 **LibLAS** - reading and processing `.las` files  
- 🌍 **GDAL** - geospatial data processing and manipulation  
- 🔄 **OpenMP (OMP)** - multi-threading for parallel computations

## 📖 Application Description

This algorithm allows users to **generate contours from `.las` files**.  
- `.las` files come from **LiDAR scans** and contain **point clouds**, where each point has data such as XYZ coordinates.  
- The algorithm processes the point cloud data to generate **accurate contours** for terrain analysis, mapping, and other geospatial applications.  
- **OpenMP** is used to enable **parallel processing** across multiple CPU threads, improving performance on large datasets.  
- **GDAL** integration allows for advanced geospatial operations and format interoperability.
